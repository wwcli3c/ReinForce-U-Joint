# ReinForce-U-Joint

🔩 U-Shaped Reinforced Joint – Project Overview
This is a redesigned U-shaped mechanical joint made to be stronger and more durable than the original version. It's modeled using CAD tools like Onshape and SolidWorks, and it's ready for real-world testing through FEA (Finite Element Analysis).

📐 Key Dimensions & Features
Base diameter: 45 mm

Arm width (span): 54 mm

Total height: 29 mm

Base thickness: 6 mm (increased for strength)

Holes: 3 on the base, 2 pivot holes on the arms

Support ribs: 2 internal ribs for added structural integrity

Rounded edges: 4 mm fillets to reduce stress points

💡 What’s Improved
Thicker base for better load support

Internal ribs to strengthen the connection between arms and base

Rounded corners to prevent weak spots

All original size constraints were respected

🧪 Ready for Testing
This part is built with simulation in mind. It’s designed to be tested using FEA tools, whether you're checking how it handles stress, identifying potential failure points, or comparing it to the original version.
